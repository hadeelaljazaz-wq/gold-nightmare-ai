<analysis>
The AI engineer's work involved an iterative development process, adapting significantly from a Telegram bot to a full-stack web application. Initial efforts focused on core features like gold and forex price fetching with robust multi-API fallbacks, AI-powered analysis, and advanced image processing for charts. User feedback consistently drove development, leading to UI/UX refinements, bug fixes, and feature expansions. A major pivot occurred when the user reprioritized Admin Panel development, followed by a comprehensive user authentication and subscription system. The engineer adeptly implemented these, including detailed backend API routes, new data models, and a re-architected frontend with separate views for authenticated and unauthenticated users. Critical React-related bugs, particularly around hook usage after the UI redesign, were systematically diagnosed and resolved, ensuring a stable and functional application.

<product_requirements>
The core product is al_kabous ai, a self-hosted application providing professional market analysis (gold, forex, chart) with real-time pricing. Initially a Telegram bot, it pivoted to a full-stack web application. Key requirements included:
1.  **Core Analysis**: Real-time XAU/USD and major forex pair pricing (EURUSD, USDJPY, GBPUSD, AUD/USD, USD/CAD, USD/CHF, NZD/USD), AI analysis (Claude), and image processing for chart analysis. Gold prices must use Metals-API primarily, with Yahoo Finance, Metals.live, and FXEmpire as fallbacks, cached for 15 minutes.
2.  **User Interface**: Royal AI Fantasy Style with specific gradients, gold accents, and a clear distinction between unauthenticated (login, register, contact, language toggle, no analysis content) and authenticated user experiences (dedicated analysis dashboard).
3.  **User Management & Subscriptions**: Multi-tier user subscriptions (Basic, Premium, VIP) determining analysis limits (e.g., Basic=1/day, Premium=5/day, VIP=unlimited), user registration (email, password, defaulting to Basic), and manual subscription assignment via an Admin Panel.
4.  **Admin Panel**: Displays user count, subscription type, user-specific analysis logs, manual enable/disable account option, and daily analysis counters.
5.  **Language**: Option for Arabic/English translation for the UI and analysis content.

<current_work>
The application, al_kabous ai, is a functional full-stack web application with a distinct Royal AI Fantasy Style UI. The current focus has been on implementing a robust user management and subscription system as per the latest user requirements.

**Current State:**
1.  **UI Separation**: The application now features a redesigned frontend that separates content for unauthenticated and authenticated users:
    *   **Homepage (Unauthenticated)**: Displays login, register, contact information (now in English as fixed), and language toggle. *Crucially, all analysis-related content (gold prices, analysis buttons, chart upload) is hidden*.
    *   **Analysis Dashboard (Authenticated)**: Upon successful login, users are directed to a separate dashboard that contains all the analysis options (gold, forex, chart analysis), gold price display, and user subscription information.
2.  **User Authentication**:
    *   **Registration**: Users can create new accounts via email and password, which default to a 'basic' subscription plan.
    *   **Login**: Registered users can log in, and their authentication state is managed.
    *   **Backend Support**: New API endpoints (, , ) and an  module are implemented. The  endpoint now correctly requires authentication.
3.  **Language Toggle**: The frontend now includes  for internationalization, with basic English and Arabic translation files set up, and the 'EN' button to switch language is visible.
4.  **Admin Panel**: Basic Admin Panel functionality is implemented for managing users (listing, toggling status, updating subscription), with backend endpoints and a frontend view.
5.  **Critical Bug Fixed**: A significant React runtime error (Rendered more hooks than during the previous render) was identified (hooks placed incorrectly in conditional renders) and successfully resolved by moving  hooks to the top level of the  component and managing form states appropriately. The application is now stable after this fix, and navigation between unauthenticated and authenticated views works as expected.

<optional_next_step>
Continue implementing the detailed subscription logic for user analysis limits (e.g., Basic=3 analyses/day), integrating it with the user authentication and admin panel, as specified by the user in Chat 180.
